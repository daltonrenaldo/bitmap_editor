# Bitmap editor

..

# Running

`>bin/bitmap_editor examples/show.txt`

# Assumptions

1. If two `I N M` exists, the second will replace the first one and will receive all the succeeding commands.
2. Command on non-existing pixels will simply be ignored (silently)

# Next Step
- integration testing
- extra mile (maybe)
